Hello!!!
- I made this game by follow to the tutorial from "Clear code" channel on youtube, since was watching his tutorial I have been more more interesting in programming game specifically is in pygame module, so I so so appreciate what has he been doing very much.

- After had watching again and again his whole tutorial (actually 4 times), I managed to understood the logic he spawned (but some  fuctions in "CAMERA_GROUPS" I wasn't learnt yet so you know I quite hesitate about it and have learnt manythings from he also from the work upgrading the game.

- After managed to wrote the game by myself, I had add and changed somethings for the game like I added
"start/end screen, button" to make it more like an actual game, changed the logic of "raccoon" also  added chilly sounds to.

(OK! That's all and it's my pleasure to let you playing and enjoying the game I made, if it has any problems just tell me!!! Thanks for reading to the end, bye!!!)
