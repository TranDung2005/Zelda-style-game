Hello!!!
- I made this game by following the tutorial from the "Clear code" channel on youtube, since watching his tutorial I have been more and more interested in programming games specifically in the pygame module, so I so so appreciate what has he been doing very much.

- After watching, again and again, his whole tutorial (actually 4 times), I managed to understand the logic he spawned (but some functions in "CAMERA_GROUPS" I wasn't learned yet so you know I quite hesitate about it and have learned many things from home also from the work upgrading the game.

- After managed to write the game by myself, I had to add and changed some things the game I added
"start/end screen, button" to make it more like an actual game, changed the logic of "raccoon" and also added chilly sounds.

(OK! That's all and it's my pleasure to let you play and enjoy the game I made if it has any problems just tell me!!! Thanks for reading to the end, bye!!!)
